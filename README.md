# restful-api-refactor

## Description

The goal for this application was to refactor an already existing RESTful API book search engine and refactor it into a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The application will be a MERN stack with a MongoDB database, a Node.js/Express.js server and API, and a React front end. The application allows you to create a user profile or login to an already existing user profile. Once logged in the user will be able to search for a book and if they find one they like they can save that book to a list of books for their user profile. The user will also be able to go to their personal profile page when they are logged in that will display their saved books. Once on their profile page the user will also be able to delete books from their saved book list.
